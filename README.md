Demo App
Funky little sample project which has unit and UI tests for 
generating data and testing Bitrise Insights.

The game itself is super simple:

- When you open the app you'll see a number and a slider
- Move the slider so it's as close to the presented number as possible
- Tap the "hit me!" button if you think the slider is where the number is
- You get points based on how close you moved the slider to the actual number. The closer it is the more points you get.
- A new number is generated and presented and a new round is started.
